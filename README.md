# CHIC
Hi, this is ou project during our Bachelor degree at HEPIA, Geneva, Switzerland.
We made this project with the help of two designers (Romain and Joanne) and with a business guy (Vignesh).
We want to thank them for their support and work during the China Hardware Innovation Camp.

We are the team Ikare.
